This model should learn from the data and be able to predict the median housing price in area, given all the metrics.\n","-     We will predict price of house on given scenerios, based on something like income of person, the age of the house , the number of rooms are available and what is the actual population of the area.\n","-     We will use feature engineering i mean we have latitude and longitude but these are only numbers we cannot predict which city or which area i mean we cannot predict anything , for that we have multiple python libraries that helps us to predict where exactly this latitude and longitude. So we're going to use feature engineering to predict the new data and apart from this we predict various prices.\n","\n","\n","**Workflow** ↘\n","-   Data ->>> Training & Testing Dataset ->>> Algorithm ->>> Evaluation ->>> Model ->>> Prediction and Production Data\n","\n","**Tools And Frameworks** ↘\n","- Python\n","- Scikit Learn\n","- matplotlib\n","- Pandas\n","- Seaborn\n","- Numpy\n","- Google Colab"],"metadata":{"id":"d8JIUU8weoU6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["---------------------------------------------"],"metadata":{"id":"2z2jiahhjhP3"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# importing the dependencies \n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing"],"metadata":{"id":"pAKkwNbLja4w"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# data = fetch_california_housing()"],"metadata":{"id":"oL0DaIJdkBIT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# print(data)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"VgnRF-AGkSFz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1660517722489,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":435,"user":{"displayName":"RASHEDIN","userId":"15453162067441304532"}},"outputId":"b8fd9958-48c5-496f-de40-94820bc12314"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{'data': array([[   8.3252    ,   41.        ,    6.98412698, ...,    2.55555556,\n","          37.88      , -122.23      ],\n","       [   8.3014    ,   21.        ,    6.23813708, ...,    2.10984183,\n","          37.86      , -122.22      ],\n","       [   7.2574    ,   52.        ,    8.28813559, ...,    2.80225989,\n","          37.85      , -122.24      ],\n","       ...,\n","       [   1.7       ,   17.        ,    5.20554273, ...,    2.3256351 ,\n","          39.43      , -121.22      ],\n","       [   1.8672    ,   18.        ,    5.32951289, ...,    2.12320917,\n","          39.43      , -121.32      ],\n","       [   2.3886    ,   16.        ,    5.25471698, ...,    2.61698113,\n","          39.37      , -121.24      ]]), 'target': array([4.526, 3.585, 3.521, ..., 0.923, 0.847, 0.894]), 'frame': None, 'target_names': ['MedHouseVal'], 'feature_names': ['MedInc', 'HouseAge', 'AveRooms', 'AveBedrms', 'Population', 'AveOccup', 'Latitude', 'Longitude'], 'DESCR': '.. _california_housing_dataset:\\n\\nCalifornia Housing dataset\\n--------------------------\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    :Number of Instances: 20640\\n\\n    :Number of Attributes: 8 numeric, predictive attributes and the target\\n\\n    :Attribute Information:\\n        - MedInc        median income in block group\\n        - HouseAge      median house age in block group\\n        - AveRooms      average number of rooms per household\\n        - AveBedrms     average number of bedrooms per household\\n        - Population    block group population\\n        - AveOccup      average number of household members\\n        - Latitude      block group latitude\\n        - Longitude     block group longitude\\n\\n    :Missing Attribute Values: None\\n\\nThis dataset was obtained from the StatLib repository.\\nhttps://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html\\n\\nThe target variable is the median house value for California districts,\\nexpressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars ($100,000).\\n\\nThis dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. census, using one row per census\\nblock group.
